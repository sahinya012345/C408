Software Developer or DevOps Engineer or an Architect, Unix./Linux is used widely and you should be aware with the issues and correct approach to resolve it.

Let’s discuss on the few of them :

Issue 1 : Server is not reachable or unable to connect Approach / Solution :
.

├── Ping the server by Hostname and IP Address

│ ├── Hostname/IP Address is pingable

│ │ ├── Issue might be on the client side as server is reachable

│ ├── Hostname is not pingable but IP Address is pingable

│ │ ├── Could be the DNS issue

│ │ │ ├── check /etc/hosts

│ │ │ ├── check /etc/resolv.conf

│ │ │ ├── check /etc/nsswitch.conf

│ │ │ ├── (Optional) DNS can also be defined in the

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>

│ ├── Hostname/IP Address both are not pingable

│ │ ├── Check the other server on its same network to see if there is Network side access issue or other overall something bad

│ │ │ ├── False: Issue is not overall network side but its with that host/server

│ │ │ ├── True: Might be overall network side issue

│ │ ├── Logged into server by Virtual Console, if the server is PoweredON. Check the uptime

│ │ ├── Check if the server has the IP, and has UP status of Network interface

│ │ │ ├── (Optional) Also check IP related information from

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>

│ │ ├── Ping the gateway, also check routes

│ │ ├── Check Selinux, Firewall rules

│ │ ├── Check physical cable conn

Issue 2 : Unable to connect to website or an application Approach / Solution :

Issue 4 : Disk Space is full issue or add/extend disk space Approach / Solution :
.

├── System Performance degradation detection

│ ├── Application getting slow/unresponsive

│ ├── Commands are not running (For Example: as / disk space is full)

│ ├── Cannot do logging and other etc

├── Analyse the issue

│ ├── Create a link to file/dir

├── New disk addition

│ ├── Simple partition

│ │ ├── Add disk to VM

│ │ ├── Check the new disk with df/lsblk command

│ │ ├── fdisk to create partition. Better to have LVM partition

│ │ ├── Create filesytem and mount it

└── …

Issue 5 : Filesystem corrupted Approach / Solution :
.

├── One of the error that cause the system unable to BOOT UP

├── Check /var/log/messages, dmesg and other log files

├── If we have a badsector logs, we have to run fsck

│ ├── True:

│ │ ├── reboot the system into resuce mode as booting it from CDROM by applying ISO

│ │ ├── proceed with option 1, which mount the original root filesystem under

/mnt/sysimage

│ │ ├── edit fstab entries or create a new file with the help of blkid and reboot

└── …

Issue 7 : Can’t cd to the directory even if user has sudo privileges Approach / Solution :
.

├── Reasons and Resolution

│ ├── Directory does not exist

│ ├── Pathname conflict: relative vs absolute path

│ ├── Parent directory permission/ownership

│ ├── Doesn’t have executable permission on target directory

│ ├── Hidden directory

└── …

Issue 8 : Can’t Create Links Approach / Solution :
.

├── Reasons and Resolution

│ ├── Target directory/File does not exist

│ ├── Pathname conflict: relative vs absolute path — (should be complete path)

│ ├── Parent directory permission/ownership

│ ├── Target file permission/ownership — (as there should be read permission)

│ ├── Hidden directory/file

└── …

Issue 9 : Running Out of Memory Approach / Solution :
.

├── Types

│ ├── Cache (L1, L2, L3)

│ ├── RAM

│ │ ├── Usage

└── …

Issue 10 : Add/ Extend the Swap Space Approach / Solution :

│ ├── Now Turned swap on #swapon

│ ├── fstab entry for persistent

└── …

├── Troubleshooting and Resolution

│ ├── System reboot/crash reasons

│ │ ├── CPU stress

│ │ ├── RAM stress

│ │ ├── Kernel fault

│ │ ├── Hardware fault

│ ├── Process restart

│ ├── restart network service

└── …

Issue 14 : Backup and Restore File Permissions in Linux Approach / Solutions :
.

├── Troubleshooting

│ ├── The best option is to create the ACL file of Dir/Files before changing the permissions in bulk

│ │ ├── Create the acl file before changing the permission (or backup the file permission): ~$ getfacl -R <dir> > permissions.acl

│ │ ├── Restore File Permissions: ~$ setfacl — restore=permissions.acl

│ ├── Restore from the VM Snapshot (But not always a good option for production)

│ ├── Rebuild the VM (this option is safe for future)

└── …

Useful Tip Related Disk Partition :
.

├── Tips

│ ├── After adding/attaching a new disk to a VM, we can get its status from lsblk command by doing ~$echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/device/rescan

│ ├── If we increase disk size of existing disk than the additional space get appended to the existing disk without affecting the already existed FileSystem and Partition

│ ├── We can also recreate the filesystem on block device as it will automatically format the old one

│ ├── If we have a disk(with created partition/FS) we can share the .vmdk to other VM. So after mounting we would have a same data as it was on previous one.
