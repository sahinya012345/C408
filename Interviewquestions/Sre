Differentiate between DevOps and SRE.
Answer: Implementing new features: DevOps is responsible for developing new feature requests to the product, whereas SREs ensure those new changes donâ€™t increase the overall failure rates in production.

Procedure flow: The DevOps team has the perspective of the development environment to make changes from development to production. SREs have a viewpoint of production, so they can make propositions to the development team to border the let-down rates notwithstanding the new variations. 

Incident handling: DevOps teams work on the incident feedback to mitigate the issue, whereas SRE conducts the post-incident reviews to identify the root cause and document the findings to offer feedback to the core development team.
